If I can't have hey.com for my work email, but I can at least copy the patterns I like. It's working out okay after a few weeks. We'll see how it develops as time goes on.

I've made two folders, `feed` and `paper trail`. I write simple rules that move things into the appropriate folder. Outlook provides a button that  allows me to easily move emails into their appropriate destination.

The power in this comes from the lack of decisions I need to make when processing email. Either the email is a confirmation/receipt that I keep for my records, or it's an announcement/internal list/marketing email that I can read at my leisure. 

I spend no time considering an email taxonomy and how to classify an email. I rely on search if I need anything. I can't wait until I can ask an AI something and it can tell me and show me the exact email or emails that contain the knowledge I need.
