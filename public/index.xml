      <description>Working on software often requires some estimation of how long tasks will take, but often these numbers are nothing more than gut feelings. I propose we look at the length of the development iteration cycle in order to provide estimates instead of &amp;ldquo;that seems easy&amp;rdquo;.
Development iteration cycle is writing code and testing it. The length being how long that process takes. On some projects, it can be 10+ minutes. On other projects it can be milliseconds.</description>

      <description>If I can&amp;rsquo;t have hey.com for my work email, but I can at least copy the patterns I like. It&amp;rsquo;s working out okay after a few weeks. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how it develops as time goes on.
I&amp;rsquo;ve made two folders, feed and paper trail. I write simple rules that move things into the appropriate folder. Outlook provides a button that allows me to easily move emails into their appropriate destination.</description>
