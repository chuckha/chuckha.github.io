I write simple rules that move things into the appropriate folder. Outlook provides a button that allows me to easily move emails into their appropriate destination.</p><p>The power in this comes from the lack of decisions I need to make when processing email. Either the email is a confirmation/receipt that I keep for my records, or it&rsquo;s an announcement/internal list/marketing email that I can read at my leisure.</p><p>I spend no time considering an email taxonomy and how to classify an email. I rely on search if I need anything. I can&rsquo;t wait until I can ask an AI something and it can tell me and show me the exact email or emails that contain the knowledge I need.</p><ul class=pa0><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/organization/ class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">organization</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/work/ class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">work</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/email/ class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">email</a></li></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://chuckha.github.io/>&copy; My New Hugo Site 2023</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
