The length being how long that process takes. On some projects, it can be 10+ minutes. On other projects it can be milliseconds. Now, using this time as a basis for estimation, I propose that 1 minute of development iteration cycle time is equal to 1 day of work. Something like this.</p><p>I think this can scale up and down and maybe could extend into &ldquo;how many development cycles can I execute in a time frame and how many development cycles will this take to get right?&rdquo; Then of course add some numbers for the complexity of reviewing, merging, and deploying.</p><p>Maybe this needs even more math.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Length of dev iteration cycle</th><th>estimation</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>10 minutes</td><td>10 days</td></tr><tr><td>1 minute</td><td>1 day</td></tr><tr><td>6 seconds</td><td>2.5 hours</td></tr><tr><td>1 second</td><td>30 minutes</td></tr><tr><td>100 milliseconds</td><td>3 minutes</td></tr></tbody></table><ul class=pa0></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://chuckha.github.io/>&copy; My New Hugo Site 2023</a><div><div class=ananke-socials></div></div></div></footer></body></html>
